Basic project that consists in creating a non-scientific calculator.

At this point, what's left to do is: 
    
    1. Fix the bug that returns NaN when working with floating numbers. This is likely due to the regular expressions used in the logic.
    2. Update the UI making it a bit more appealing.
    3. *Include another event listener to each one of the buttons, so that they are responsive not only to clicks, but also to the keyboard*
    4. Making the calculator more "scientific". This could be done with a better use of Regular Expressions and a loop, or, even better, recursion.
