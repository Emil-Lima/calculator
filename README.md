Basic project that consists in creating a non-scientific calculator.

At this point, what's left to do is: 
    
    1. Adapt the layout to mobile phones.
    2. *Include another event listener for each one of the buttons, so that they are responsive not only to clicks, but also to the keyboard*
    3. Making the calculator more "scientific". This could be done with a better use of Regular Expressions and a loop, or, even better, recursion.
