Basic project that consists in creating a non-scientific calculator.

At this point, what's left to do is: 

    1. Update the UI making it at least somewhat appealing.
    2. Including a second smalled "screen" at the top of the current screen. This new screen would show the last mathematical operation that the user passed into the calculator.
    3. *Include another event listener to each one of the buttons, so that they are responsive not only to clicks, but also to the keyboard*
    4. Making the calculator more "scientific".
